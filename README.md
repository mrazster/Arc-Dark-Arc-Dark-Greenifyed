Arc-Dark-Greenifyed

As said, a theme based on Arc-Dark but with my own spin on it and with an "greenish" accentcolor that would work with both my own wallpaper wich can be found in the files, and with the Zafiro icontheme. I choose the Zafiro icons because of their kind ow "washed out colors" wich I think goes well with the whole feel of the theme. I created this theme for my self and to fitt my needs. I won´ t doing any updates and changes to it. Feel free to use it as you see fit. The icons used in my sidebar is application launhers in xfcepanel with modified icons from the Zafiro icon theme and can be found in the "zafiro icon mod" folder. ATM there is no support for Gnome-Shell and I don´ t plan on adding anytime soon since I don´ t use it my self.
